<td>This is one of THE most popular dog breeds, and for good reason—the Labrador Retriever is playful, patient, loving, protective, and reliable. Another perk—Labs are highly intelligent and take well to training. Make sure that they have plenty of room to run around and play. These affable dogs get along well with other animals and pretty much everyone they meet, plus their short coats mean that they only really need a weekly combing to keep them clean and healthy.</td>

<td>Poodles are available in both miniature and standard sizes, meaning you can choose the specific Poodle size that best matches your living environment. They’re great for kids with allergies, as they shed very little. Each breed comes with different perks. The Standard Poodle breed, for example, is very obedient, smart, playful, and adventurous. Although they are often shy with strangers, they get along great with people and kids that they know. Miniature Poodles, on the other hand, tend to dedicate themselves to one person in particular, but they are good with other pets and kids. They are smart, responsive, obedient, and playful.</td>
